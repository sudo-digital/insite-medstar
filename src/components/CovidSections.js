    <h4>Scheduling Tips</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Make a schedule that kids follow each day. Example: wake up, family yoga/exercise routine, reading, art, math, meditation, outside time, independent play, etc. Limit screen time to set periods of the day and set places in the house.</li>
      <li>Connect with other caregivers in your community and consider offering kids the option to do a video chat that is just for kids. Our kids will be scared and may not want to share this with adults. It’s good for them to talk to each other.</li>
      <li>In your caregiver network, consider offering resources digitally to the children in that community. For example, a drama teacher could teach a creative storytelling class once a week. This helps the kids stay connected to trusted families, and caregivers feel more grounded in shared community even though we are at a distance.</li>
      <li>Get outside!</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Family Games</h4>
    <li>Play school: teaching the stuffed animals, etc.</li>
    <li>Make comic books.</li>
    <li>Old game/new rules: use a board game you have and make up new rules; can be a collaborative activity for siblings.</li>
    <li>Create "make me laugh!" videos -- usually this is one kid filming the other kid as they try and make each other laugh. And then the rewatch the videos and launch all over again.</li>
    <li>Coziest bed ever: make the other person the most cozy, cuddly bed ever, in a non-bed spot. Often results in napping :)</li>
    <li>Art project: watch Bob Ross online videos on how to paint and paint along with him</li>
    <li>Make a marble/small run: take all paper towel rolls, toilet paper rolls, and other cardboard type items and tape them to the wall to make a maze</li>
    <li>Improvisation games</li>
    <li>World of Dance (Based on the tv series): Kids choose a song, make up a dance, and rehearse it (costumes encouraged!). After 5-20 minutes of prep, each child performs their piece for the audience/judges. After all performances have ended, judges confer, and “lock in their scores. All contestants receive feedback on performance aspects, such as facial expressions, choreography, musicality, and technical skills. Each contestant is given a score, and the one with the highest total wins the round.</li>
