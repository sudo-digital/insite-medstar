                  <p>In 2018, InSite Solutions and Georgetown Universityâ€™s Department of Child Psychiatry merged to create a regional center for school-based mental health: The MedStar Georgetown Center for Wellbeing in School Environments (WISE Center). This partnership seeks to expand access to our high-quality, multidisciplinary school-based experts in direct clinical service and trauma-informed whole-school programming; train the next generation of mental health practitioners, skilled in the application of evidence-based clinical knowledge to individuals, families, and systems; and provide a deeper evaluation of programmatic outcomes and disseminate knowledge in the wider educational and mental health communities.</p>

                <p id='program'><b>Program Details</b><br/>Externs are placed within our partnering school systems, each of which are well-experienced at utilizing and valuing the important role of doctoral externs. These schools serve students ages 3 to 18, most of whom live in communities of poverty and experience chronic adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). As a result, the WISE Center utilizes <b>a trauma-informed approach</b> to the services we provide to schools and the training we provide to externs.</p>
